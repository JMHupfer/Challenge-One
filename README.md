# Challenge-One
First Challenge
This week is an odd-numbered week, so my Challenge is an on-the-job ticket—meaning that I will begin with starter code that I need to modify.

Refactoring existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology is a common task for front-end and junior developers. For this particular Challenge, a marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

Important: When working with someone else's code, I should adhere to the Scout Rule—always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it.

An increasingly important consideration for businesses, web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibility is good for business—for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.

Accessibility can include complex requirements, but my tech lead has given me a small list of specific criteria for this project. These criteria are documented in the Acceptance Criteria section.
